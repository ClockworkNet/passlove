Depends
=======
- Word list or dictionary

  - If no word list is provided on the command line, it defaults to using ``/usr/share/dict/american-english-huge``, which is distributed by the Debian or Ubuntu wamerican-huge package. If you're not using either and your system doesn't have an alternative, it's probably easiest to extract the file from the dpkg.
  - `Ubuntu -- Details of package wamerican-huge in precise <http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/wamerican-huge>`_
  - `Kevin's Word List Page <http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/>`_ (wamerican-huge is based on SCOWL)

Good (72 bits of Entropy)

Good passwords should be able to withstand unrestricted brute force attempts by national governments and bot nets.

Moderate (63 bits of Entropy)

Rate limited to 9 guesses per 3 minutes                      0.05  *over 2 trillion*
===========================================  ====================  ==============================

Moderate passwords should be able to withstand unrestricted brute force attempts by local governments and persistent hackers.

Distributed.net guesses per second (RC5-72)  1,105,696,629,234.00  *less than a second*

===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============

Weak passwords are only viable if they are **never** used on multiple systems and the system they are used on has a mechanism for rate limiting guesses.

Unfortunately, systems that rate limit guesses (ex. lockout thresholds) are still rare. Additionally, even systems with lockout thresholds are often compromised, making the passwords hashes available.

Systems that default to having **no** lockout threshold:
